#Watermark-Test

A global publishing company that publishes books and journals wants to develop a service to watermark their documents. Book publications include topics in business, science and media. Journals don’t include any specific topics. A document (books, journals) has a title, author and a watermark property. An empty watermark property indicates that the document has not been watermarked yet.

The watermark service has to be asynchronous. For a given content document the service should return a ticket, which can be used to poll the status of processing. If the watermarking is finished the document can be retrieved with the ticket. The watermark of a book or a journal is identified by setting the watermark property of the object. For a book the watermark includes the properties content, title, author and topic. The journal watermark includes the content, title and author. 

Examples for watermarks:

    {content:”book”, title:”The Dark Code”, author:”Bruce Wayne”, topic:”Science”}
    {content:”book”, title:”How to make money”, author:”Dr. Evil”, topic:”Business”}
    {content:”journal”, title:”Journal of human flight routes”, author:”Clark Kent”}


* Create an appropriate object-oriented model for the problem.
* Implement the Watermark-Service, meeting the above conditions.
* Provide Unit-Tests to ensure the functionality of the service.

#Solution in scala

## code
 - created a spring boot application using service interfaces for local tickets and documents
 - provided a simple concurrent map based implementation for these services
 - the watermark service uses those services to process the tickets
 - jsonviews are used to select the properties for the mapping
 - a rest service provides external access for the requested operation
 - an async task and a threadpoolexecutor are handling the async watermarking
 - without the rest service a future should be used to wait for the result instead of the wait loop
 - the async implementation just processes the list in creation order....
 - **instead the watermark task could be started asynchronously only for the requested ticket 
   with some effects on the required datastructures**
 
## tests 
 - tests for the business logic in the local watermarkservice
 - integration tests using MockMvc for the rest service
